EDA ON DATA SCIENCE JOB SALARIES DATASET



This task is centred around providing a data visualization on data science jobs salary. Data used for this analysis was provided by #10Alytics. 
I made use of certain libraries in Python such as Numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib to achieve my goal of an extensive exploratory analysis of the data at hand. 
Data was loaded into the python script using pandas and feature analysis was thereafter performed in order for me to familiarize with the data- Univariate and Bivariate analysis were conducted on all the categorical and Numeric columns.
46% of the workforce were in the senior level cadre, while 4% were in the executive position. Data scientists, Data Engineer and Data Analyst were the most employed groups among the 51 (fifty-one) various   professionals employed in the organisation. It was likewise discovered that 97% of the workers were full time staff members. 
There are 57 different locations in the organisation, out of which United States branch has more than 50% of the workers working in the branch location. 52% of the workforce joined in the year 2022 as against 36% in 2021 and 12% in 2020, this implies that the company is progressing. 
The average salary being paid to a Data science professional is $112,298. Most people collect 
salaries within the range of $100,000 which is fair enough for living. There are few outlier who earned 
more than triple of this anyway. It can be deduced that Data science job is highly rewarding. 
Post covid job pattern had its effect here as 63% of the workforce worked fully remotely, while just 21% work from the office.
Over the years, there has been a percentage increase in the number of people opting to work fully remotely. More of the partially remote workers switched to either fully remote or no remote in 2022. 
There are also more full time workers in all levels of experience when compared to other categories of employment such as contract staff, partime and freealnce staff.

The medium sized category company had more staff in all. Almost an equal number of entry level workers were engaged in all the three 3 categories of the company. Large and medium sized have almost the same number of executive cadre, only the small sized locations had a reduced numbers of executives. This may be due to the fact that the company is still budding at those small locations. Mid-level workers had most of the workers in the medium sized category companies and least of its workers on the small sized category companies.
 USA had a highest distribution of all the different level of experience in the workforce. The question here is that why is there no executive officer cadre in Great Britain, whereas, Poland with lower number of workforce have some Executive staff with them.
It is most likely the productivity of the organisation increased in 2022 as they paid higher amount of salary in 2022 than in the previous years. The result here in salary in USD by work-year shows that more people are earning far higher in 2022 than they were earning in 2020 and 2021. 
Some senior level cadre earned higher than Executive categories of workers. This sounds strange to know. It was also observed that few people working at the small sized company earned fat salaries as compared to medium and large sized branches. In actual fact, more of medium sized branches staff earned more.
Out of the 8 topmost earners, it is observed that Data Scientist and Director of Data Science had the highest pay of $11,000,000. Data science manager and principal data scientist had the next level of high pay. Data Science Consultant also had a good share of the top earners.
Interestingly, 5 locations collect 94% of the salary being paid by the organisation out of over 25 locations.
